  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Since leaving Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) in 2017 I have been engaged in small consulting initiatives and I have been active in completing formal and informal education on the current technologies and transformation strategies. This was
    intended to build upon the work that I was doing at HPE by broadening the technologies and methodologies that I used at HPE.
  </p>
  <p>
    Course work that I have completed includes Azure Solutions Architecture, AWS Solution Architecture, UIPath Solutions Architecture (a leader in Robotic Process Automation), Machine Learning/Business Intelligence, UX/UI Design, mobile application
    development and architecture primarily with the iOS platform but also with cross platform tools and technologies used in the development of full stack solutions.
  </p>
  <p>
    During my tenure at HPE I had the opportunity to work with clients to guide them through the development of technology transformation strategies, especially focused on the assessment of workloads and the options available for moving those
    workloads to the cloud. As a client Chief Technologist Officer (CTO) I was accountable for engaging and coaching clients through their transformation strategy that involved technologies such as cloud, machine learning/business intelligence and
    robotic process automation. I also designed proposed transformation strategies that formed part of RFP responses. I completed an HPE Training program called Spartans which was specific to driving business value through cloud solutions and was
    trained on the detailed cloud assessment methodology.
  </p>
  <p>
    I believe that my past experience with HPE and my clients along with the recent training that I have undertaken over the last few years uniquely position me to help any company define your approach to cloud services. I also have the experience
    required to work with your team and aid in the development of a cloud strategy that includes a workload assessment methodology that could then be used in refining your technology offerings.
